## Problem Statement

To Build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. <br>
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 

Dataset curated from ISIC with images of the skin cancer.

**GOAL** : <br>
> A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
